# The makers' choice for sysadmins, developers and desktop

![Hey!](https://www.opensuse.org/build/images/opensuse-conference.jpg)

The openSUSE project is a worldwide effort that promotes the use of Linux everywhere. We create one of the world's [best Linux distributions](https://get.opensuse.org/), as well as a variety of tools, such as [OBS](https://openbuildservice.org/), [OpenQA](http://open.qa/), [Kiwi](http://opensuse.github.io/kiwi/), [YaST](https://yast.opensuse.org/), [OSEM](https://osem.io/). Working together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of the worldwide Free and Open Source Software community.

The project is controlled by its community and relies on the contributions of individuals, working as testers, writers, translators, usability experts, artists and ambassadors or developers. The project embraces a wide variety of technology, people with different levels of expertise, speaking different languages and having different cultural backgrounds.

Have a lot of fun...
